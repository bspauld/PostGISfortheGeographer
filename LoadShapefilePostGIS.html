  <h1>PostGIS for the Geographer - Loading Data into PostGIS with QGIS</h1>

    Loading shapefile into PostGIS with QGIS is a fairly easy process. The following steps will outline this process.

    1. In QGIS, connect to your PostGIS ready database. In the Browser Panel, right click on the PostGIS menu item and select New Connection
    2. In the Create a New PostGIS connection window, enter information for the name of the connection, the host (I used localhost), 
    the port, and the database name - PostGISforGeographer.  Click on Test Connection to test the set-up. You will be asked to enter your credentials,
    with the database username and password.
    3. Once the connection has been established, you will use DB Manager plugin in QGIS to load the shapefiles into PostGIS.  
    If you need to install the plugin, simply use the functionality available in the QGIS Plugin Manager.  For more detailed instructions check out
