# PostGISfortheGeographer
Series of simple example PostgreSQL/PostGIS scripts that geographers (or anyone) might find useful

New scripts will be added over the next couple weeks, with sample data is available below.

All scripts and tables used here are based on the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc280487.aspx">GEOMETRY data type</a>

Data used in scripts and tutorials can be downloaded <a href="http://www.gisdoctor.com/downloads/Tutorial_Spatial_Data.zip">here (it's a 28mb zip)</a>.  All data originally downloaded from <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth's awesome website</a>

If there are any specific PostgreSQL/PostGIS scripts you would like to see, shoot me a message @GISDoctor.
